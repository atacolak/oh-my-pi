# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `--agent <name>` to start a root session from a discovered agent definition (user `~/.omp/agent/agents`, project `.omp/agents`, extension, or bundled). The agent's tools, thinking level, model, body, and autoload skills apply unless `--tools` / `--thinking` / `--model` / `--system-prompt` override them. Unknown names fail with a usage error listing available agents.
- Added `--agent-cwd <path>` to resolve a named root agent from a role-definition project while keeping `--cwd` as the execution directory, and added `hide: true` agent frontmatter so explicitly named automation roles remain root-launchable without appearing in ambient task or `/agents` rosters.
- Resume and fork now restore a session's original `--agent` identity from the session header. A conflicting `--agent` is refused, and a persisted privileged role that is missing from discovery fails closed.
- Root `--agent` sessions now evaluate `agents` frontmatter rule scoping against the launched definition name, including restore from the session header.

## [18.1.15] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Added `advisor.maxNotesPerUpdate` setting and `WATCHDOG.yml` configuration (default `4`): allows reasoning verifiers to batch findings in a single review update without being rate-limited.
- Headless browser tabs now freeze when a turn settles so idle animated/WebGL pages stop burning CPU/GPU, resuming automatically on next use; tabs idle past `browser.idleCloseSec` (default 30 minutes) are closed. `persist: true` on `browser.open` opts a tab out of both ([#8246](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/8246) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).

### Changed

- When enabled (`task.showResolvedModelBadge`), subagent model badges show the thinking-level icon, model name, and attached-advisor eye before the agent name in task, eval, job, and HUD rows.

### Fixed

- Task descriptions containing tabs no longer misalign or overflow task rows; tabs are expanded before measuring and rendering.
- GitHub Copilot model-policy 403s (plan, model policy, org restriction) no longer delete stored credentials, so the provider stays listed in `/model` after a per-model access denial instead of disappearing until the next `/login` ([#11280](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11280) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Bash results no longer replace a failing command's output with the shell minimizer's lossy summary when the original capture cannot be persisted as an artifact; the raw diagnostics are kept so a failure stays actionable ([#11081](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/11081)).
- Fixed worker subprocesses failing to declare themselves as worker hosts before dispatching selectors, which prevented nested thread worker spawns during `/usage` stats sync on multi-core systems.
- Fixed `/usage` displaying a misleading generic database read failure when activity loading fails; the error detail is now sanitized, collapsed to a single line with shortened paths, and surfaced in the dashboard.
- Advisor notes now report rate limiting accurately, blockers always interrupt even after a lower-severity note in the same update, and deferred notes flush when the primary run completes, including after advisor quota exhaustion ([#11062](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/11062)).
- Fixed the built-in clangd registration omitting CUDA source and header files (`.cu` and `.cuh`) ([#10782](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10782) by [@alphastorm](https://github.com/alphastorm)).
- Fixed `ast_grep` skipping CUDA headers and ignoring an explicit `lang` override for ambiguous file extensions ([#10782](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10782) by [@alphastorm](https://github.com/alphastorm)).
- Python cells are no longer replayed automatically after a kernel crash, preventing duplicate side effects; the next call starts a fresh kernel.
- Session rewrites preserve open-reader snapshots and replacement identity when a rename needs an EPERM fallback.
- Fixed WorkPool children retaining a stale Gemini-formatted `yield` declaration when pooled items were installed or cleared.

## [18.1.14] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The startup update notice counts every change in a release: bullets written above a `###` heading now count under `Other`, and `+`/`*` markers and lightly indented bullets count like `-`.
- Fixed Codex Astra retaining its larger window after disabling Extended Context, including cached models; explicit model overrides still take precedence.
- Fixed explicit Codex context-window overrides widening past the server-honored maximum; they now clamp to the documented ceiling like upstream Codex ([#11157](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11157) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Fixed Astra's extended window over-advertising input by 128K; it now uses the documented 922K input cap inside the 1.05M total context ([#11157](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11157) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Bills Astra API requests above 272K input at the documented 2x input / 1.5x output long-context tier; the Codex subscription route stays exempt with free cache writes ([#11157](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11157) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Fixed Extended Context silently enabling without a settings source (SDK embedding, early boot); it now matches the off default until opted in ([#11157](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11157) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Fixed `/copy` link captions showing Markdown delimiters for formatted labels and splitting across two rows for multiline labels ([#11086](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11086) by [@mustafaabidali](https://github.com/mustafaabidali)).
- Fixed Ask custom answers requiring another submission after paste or remaining on the same multi-select question; pending clipboard text is preserved before submission, and single-question multi-select answers still go through review ([#11099](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11099) by [@camjac251](https://github.com/camjac251)).
- The startup update notice no longer counts standalone `* * *` and `- - -` separator lines as changes.
- Fixed `/loop` replacing the repeating prompt with a mid-turn interjection; steering while the agent runs is now one-off, and only an idle submission becomes the new loop body ([#11159](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11159) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).

## [18.1.13] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed GPT-6 Astra requiring `/extended-context` for its full context window: it now keeps the documented 1.05M-token window with the setting on or off, and explicit per-model `contextWindow` overrides still win.

## [18.1.12] - 2026-09-06

- Fixed edit and write results to report the formatted bytes actually committed by LSP writethrough.

### Changed

- Ranged reads of text without bracket characters skip unnecessary lexical context scanning.
- Muse Code sessions send a compact hashline edit description (~3 KB less per request); all other models keep the full prompt.

### Fixed

	- Fixed GPT-6 Astra extended-context support and preserved maximum context windows reported by OpenAI Codex discovery ([#10980](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10980) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Subagent `yield` no longer rejects a valid `data` payload because a non-strict OpenAI-compatible backend filled the optional `error` field with `""`; previously the worker retried the identical call until the invalid-yield cap and the parent received nothing.
- Fixed fullscreen `/copy` outlining only a lazily created grouped Read card, so Enter copies the assistant yield instead of tool output.
- `memory://` now resolves against the session that issued it: a caller's own memory backend answers `memory://<id>`, so co-located sessions no longer read each other's memory rows, and a caller whose session is no longer live fails closed instead of being answered by a peer. Prompt completion binds to the same caller, so `memory://<memory-id>` stays on offer while a subagent shares the working directory. Advisors retain their owning session's memory access even without a session file.
- Fullscreen `/copy` now opens on the recent tail of the branch instead of replaying the whole session, so it appears immediately and steps without lag on long sessions (`a` loads the earlier turns). Both it and the esc-esc rewind selector also cache each transcript row set instead of re-stripping it every frame.
- Fixed the fullscreen `/copy` and esc-esc rewind selectors repainting the whole frame for a wheel notch that cannot move the viewport; because both open scrolled to the newest turn, wheeling down there made the frame twitch.

## [18.1.11] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Added the `retry.waitForUsageReset` setting: when a provider reports usage-limit exhaustion with a reset time (5-hour or weekly quota windows on any provider), the session sleeps until the reset instead of failing fast past `retry.maxDelayMs`.
- Added opt-in `bash.allowCompoundCommands` approval for conservative literal `&&` chains, with ordered per-segment rules and normal bash policy fallback for unmatched segments. The opt-in requires a positively classified POSIX-quoting shell; incompatible and unknown shells retain legacy approval. Whole-chain denies take precedence over earlier prompts.

### Fixed

- Fixed `todo` and other tools called through eval rejecting optional `None`/`null` arguments that direct tool calls accept.
- Report oversized selected lines that cannot fit after read context, with a working raw recovery selector instead of a looping continuation hint ([#10775](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10775)).
- Fixed WorkPool child sessions crashing during startup while constructing their incremental `yield` tool schema.
- Commit summaries written in Vietnamese, Korean, and other accented scripts are no longer rejected for exceeding the length limit, and keep their accents as typed.
- Tool-scoped TTSR rules now match finalized arguments reliably when providers stream short or throttled tool calls ([#10910](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10910)).

## [18.1.10] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Subagent `yield` now takes `data`/`error` directly instead of nesting them under a `result` wrapper.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex V2 remote compaction rebuilding the request prefix differently from normal turns, restoring prompt-cache reuse ([#10786](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10786)).
- Restored mouse clicks, hover, and wheel scrolling in Plan Review.

## [18.1.9] - 2026-09-04

### Breaking Changes

- Browser and computer automation now use JavaScript/Python evaluation preludes with reusable tab and element handles, replacing the previous standalone tool schemas and object-shaped run APIs.
- Replaced the `inspect_image` tool and `/vision` controls with `read <image>?q=<question>` for image questions; text-only models now receive image metadata and guidance for using this selector.
- Renamed `inspect_image.timeoutMs` to `images.questionTimeoutMs`; existing settings are migrated automatically.

### Added

- Bash now extracts Kitty and Sixel terminal graphics as image results for foreground, failed, manual, and background executions.
- Markdown links to existing local files and resources are now clickable while preserving their displayed URLs.
- Added `/switch <model>` for session-only model changes, with the same model selectors and completions supported by `--model`; ACP `/model <model>` accepts these selectors as well.
- Added the `worktree.cleanSource` setting to reset and clean the original checkout when creating a worktree with `/wt`.
- Expanded the computer JavaScript/Python evaluation prelude with direct desktop, window, screenshot, accessibility, and element interaction helpers, while keeping `computer.run` available for multi-step scripts.

### Changed

- Agent delegation is now model-aware, allowing some models to favor focused inline work instead of spawning subagents.

### Fixed

- Fixed fallback authorization-code prompts remaining active after native OAuth callback completion.
- Fixed reciprocal idle subagents repeatedly waking one another indefinitely.
- Fixed `/wt` and `git worktree add` failing when the new worktree targeted the same commit as the clean source checkout.
- Fixed omp-installed marketplace plugins and `--plugin-dir` plugins losing their skills when the Claude plugin source was not separately enabled ([#10743](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10743)).
- Fixed session accent colors rendering as bright white in terminals without truecolor support, including Terminal.app ([#10759](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10759)).
- Rules with `enabled: false` frontmatter are now omitted during discovery, matching disabled skills ([#10769](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10769)).
- Fixed large MCP tool-result previews losing the relevant tail content when an oversized output line preceded it ([#10761](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10761)).
- Fixed `Ctrl+V` replacing CJK characters with `?` when pasting from XWayland clipboard owners on Wayland ([#10762](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10762)).
- Fixed byte-limited artifact reads reporting the displayed byte count instead of the actual read limit ([#10764](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10764)).
- Fixed read-tool truncation notices incorrectly reporting zero delivered lines or bytes when previewing a partial oversized line ([#10768](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10768)).
- Fixed Mnemopi removing explicitly retained or learned long-term memory after sessions longer than 24 hours by consolidating eligible working memory at session start ([#10770](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10770)).

### Removed

- Removed the librarian agent.

## [18.1.8] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Improved background task results with structured output schemas: parsed results are now available through the `agent://<id>` resource, while large or invalid inline JSON is replaced with a reliable pointer to the complete result.
- Background task artifacts are retained long enough for follow-up turns to read them, including failed tasks that lack valid structured output, and are cleaned up without blocking shutdown or leaking resources.
- Fixed context compaction incorrectly accepting archived history that was larger because of opaque reasoning data, allowing the next compaction strategy to run instead.
- Fixed the Model Hub sidebar jumping to the top when provider refreshes rebuild the list; the focused model, or its nearest remaining entry, is now preserved.
- Fixed the `inspect_image` status hint showing the wrong model after switching between image-capable model roles.
- Fixed multi-minute TUI freezes during subagent activity and batch execution.

## [18.1.7] - 2026-09-03

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the Ruby and Julia eval backends and related interpreter configuration; eval now supports Python and JavaScript only.
- Removed the eval parallel() and pipeline() helpers. agent() and completion() now return handles immediately, and wait(handles) provides synchronization.
- Python eval tool calls are now asynchronous coroutines, matching JavaScript; use await tool.read({...}) and similar calls.

### Added

- Added asynchronous eval agent and completion handles with status, cancellation, messaging, waiting, and automatic result delivery for unwaited background work.
- Added eval workpools for queueing items onto the least context-loaded keep-alive subagent with configurable concurrency; the pool name is its async-job ID for `hub wait`, `.peek()` gives a non-consuming snapshot, per-item `{key, data|error}` yields finish batches incrementally, and `eval.workpool.freshAgents` opts into a new agent per item.
- Added support for defining eval tools in Python with @tool or JavaScript with tool(fn, schema), and exposing them to subagents through task, agent, and workpool calls. Configure availability with eval.tools.enabled.
- Added native Windows ARM64 binaries with architecture-aware installation and updates.
- Added an MLX backend for running local tiny models on Apple silicon. Configure providers.tinyModelDevice=mlx, or use PI_TINY_DEVICE=mlx or metal, to run title generation, memory tasks, and automatic thinking classification with MLX models, with an ONNX CPU fallback when Python is unavailable.
- Added Qwen3 1.7B as a local memory and thinking-classification model for the MLX backend.

### Changed

- Local tiny models for titles, memory, and automatic thinking classification now share on-demand workers across omp processes, reducing redundant resource usage; workers stop automatically after inactivity.
- PI_TINY_DEVICE=metal now selects the MLX backend on macOS.
- Updated agent reactions to trigger on the opening emoji instead of requiring a newline, consuming any following whitespace.

### Fixed

- Fixed transient provider retries incorrectly failing with an “Agent is already processing” error.
- Fixed user-scope marketplace plugins installed through omp losing their skills when the Claude plugin source was not separately enabled.
- Fixed hashline edits failing when targets included apply_patch markers, while rejecting ambiguous bracketed targets instead of editing the wrong path.
- Fixed bracketed hashline edit targets being reported as undefined to extension path allowlists.
- Fixed MCP tools discovered during startup disappearing after plan-mode approval or when leaving default-on plan mode.
- Fixed ACP clients receiving invalid file locations or updates for released terminals, preventing invalid worktree scans and terminal errors on Windows.

## [18.1.6] - 2026-09-03

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the local session-title model choices with LFM2.5 230M, LFM2.5 350M, and Falcon H1 Tiny 90M.
- Reserved main and sub as built-in subagent definition names; custom agents can no longer use these names.

### Added

- Added agent reactions: a reply that opens with a lone emoji line shows the emoji as a badge on your message bubble instead of in the text; toggle the prompt invitation with the tui.reactions setting.
- Added video attachment and reading support through ffmpeg, including preview grids with metadata and timestamp/frame selectors such as :412 and :1h5m42s.
- Enhanced the model picker with intelligence indicators, catalog TPS estimates, provider-aware ranking, and provider-supplied badges and descriptions.
- Added detailed, non-summarized findings for scout agents through the report definition field, and subagent result relay so read-only agents can return data to their originating agent.
- Added agent-scoped rules using an agents frontmatter field with glob matching, including support for inspecting applicable rules with omp ttsr list and omp ttsr test --agent.
- Added non-interrupting extension messages through deliverAs: "aside" for pi.sendMessage and pi.sendUserMessage.
- Added copy and open controls for rendered blocks and links, including /copy link and the /open command.
- Added option-click cursor positioning in the prompt entry box.
- Added the configurable opencode display layout, with a corresponding first-run and upgrade setup option.
- Added the skillful prompt setting and /skillful command to control whether available skills are listed in the system prompt.
- Added Firecrawl as an optional providers.fetch backend for URL reading, configurable with FIRECRAWL_API_KEY and FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL.
- Added provider request metadata configuration for usage and cost attribution, including Amazon Bedrock request headers and User-Agent customization.
- Added the :-N read selector for reading the last N lines from files, directories, archives, artifacts, internal URLs, and web URLs, including combinations such as :raw:-60.
- Added an opt-in extension status-line segment for displaying custom statuses inline.
- Added injectV1: false to openai-models-list discovery for OpenAI-compatible gateways whose model endpoint is rooted at a versioned URL.
- Added provider-reported credits and routed-model counts to /session statistics.
- Added CLINE_API_KEY to the CLI environment help for native ClinePass subscription inference.
- Expanded Devin model selectors to support native CLI aliases, dotted upstream names, and dynamic effort-route identifiers.
- Standalone CLAUDE.md files in the project root and ancestor directories are now loaded as project context alongside AGENTS.md files.

### Changed

- Session history is now sorted by modification time, then creation time, then file path.
- Increased the maximum file snapshot size to 4 MB.
- Edit tools now provide streamed diff previews while applying changes.
- Approved plan content is included directly in agent history, reducing redundant reads.
- power.sleepPrevention now works on Linux and Windows. Its idle default keeps long-running sessions awake on those platforms; set it to off to restore the previous behavior.
- Unsupported-model errors no longer include incorrect retry instructions.

### Fixed

- Fixed local title models receiving unsupported online examples and failing with certain tokenizer templates.
- Fixed model picker search selection so it moves to the best matching result after results change.
- Fixed /new sometimes reviving the previous conversation in the current process or after a restart.
- Fixed raw text escaping in agent responses.
- Fixed structured subagent result previews being truncated incorrectly.
- Fixed /usage taking several seconds to become responsive on large statistics databases.
- Fixed the status line not appearing correctly in the first startup frame.
- Fixed shell builtins reporting broken-pipe errors when downstream commands exit early.
- Fixed provider-qualified model roles with dotted revisions resolving to the wrong provider or model.
- Fixed agent-scoped rules being lost when subagents are restored, and fixed rule:// URLs and rule inspection to consistently use the calling agent's applicable rules.
- Fixed extension and user asides being stranded, delivered to the wrong session, or incorrectly interrupting or restarting turns during session changes and image processing.
- Fixed parent steering messages arriving during a subagent's final result from preventing that result from being committed.
- Fixed messages typed while an edit or write tool was streaming from discarding the completed tool call and triggering unnecessary regeneration.
- Fixed self-hosted Firecrawl URLs with origin-only base URLs from gaining an extra slash.
- Fixed omp commit auto-staging from including macOS Unicode-normalization duplicates or files ignored by nested .gitignore rules.

## [18.1.5] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added Abliteration provider support to `/login`, including `ABLITERATION_API_KEY` configuration and help text.
- Added clone-first Git worktree support that carries over ignored build artifacts when creating worktrees, with a configurable `worktree.clone` setting and fallback to a standard checkout. This is supported by `github pr_checkout`, `omp worktree add`, and `git worktree add` commands entered through the Bash tool.
- Added the `omp worktree add` command with Git-compatible branch, detach, path, and commit options.
- Added `/wt` (alias `/worktree`) to create a linked worktree with uncommitted changes and move the current session into it while leaving the original checkout untouched.

### Changed

- Foreign user-level configuration sources (`~/.cursor`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.codeium/windsurf`) are now opt-in via `enabledProviders`, while project-level configurations in CWD and `.agents` continue to load by default.
- Split subagent isolation configuration into `task.isolation.enabled` and `isolation.backend`; existing `task.isolation.mode` settings are migrated automatically.
- Updated the built-in `smol` and `slow` model priority chains to favor newer recommended models and remove older model generations.
- Improved unsupported-model error messages by removing retry guidance that does not apply.

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic title generation so `--no-title` also prevents todo-initialization title refreshes, while automatic titles retain the selected OAuth account without sharing foreground request identity.
- Fixed provider errors so they wrap to the terminal width and remain readable in the transcript and pinned error banner, with long messages available through the expansion hint.
- Fixed Gemini malformed function-call turns so textual tool-call output is rejected conversationally and the session can continue instead of stopping with a pinned error.
- Fixed auto-compaction recovery getting stuck in repeated retries when models return empty length-limited responses; it now stops with an actionable error.
- Fixed MCP servers failing to reconnect after transient startup handshake timeouts.
- Fixed programs supervised by `hub start` hanging when querying terminal capabilities.
- Fixed large pastes followed immediately by Enter so the input is submitted with the pasted content instead of being left in the large-paste menu.

### Removed

- Removed the bundled `designer` subagent and `designer` model role; `modelRoles.designer` and `@designer` are no longer built in.

## [18.1.3] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- The `doubleEscapeAction` setting now accepts `tree`, so double-Escape can open the session tree instead of the rewind selector.
- Updated the visual representation for the IRC tool from "irc" to "#"
- Rewinding to a user message (double-Escape, `/branch`) now branches within the current session — the old path stays reachable in `/tree` — instead of forking a child session; `/rewind` is an alias for `/branch` ([#10565](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10565) by [@anatoli-tsinovoy](https://github.com/anatoli-tsinovoy)).

### Fixed

- Active sessions now keep memory proportional to truncated raw SSE and tool outputs instead of retaining complete oversized backing strings ([#10547](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10547)).
- Anthropic sessions now keep tool-roster changes and warm-prefix pruning from invalidating preserved thinking or the prompt cache.
- TypeScript code intelligence now works on TypeScript 7 projects: the built-in `typescript-native` server runs `tsc --lsp --stdio` when the resolved TypeScript install no longer ships `tsserver.js`, replacing `typescript-language-server` for that project.
- Claude marketplace MCP servers now resolve environment placeholders in stdio environment values instead of passing strings such as `${NAME:-}` literally ([#10481](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10481) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).
- Fixed prewalk conflicting with `todo.eager=always`: the forced eager-todo prelude ("call todo first this turn") was injected alongside the prewalk plan nudge ("write a complete plan first, then todo"), giving the model contradictory instructions; the eager-todo prelude is now suppressed only when prewalk will perform a handoff ([#10510](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10510)).
- Fixed `authHeader: true` + command-backed `apiKey` discovery providers (no explicit `headers:` block) resending a stale bearer after a 401 force-refresh; discovered models now re-derive `Authorization` from the live `apiKey` each request ([#10551](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10551)).
- Fixed the embedded shell's `command -v`/`-V` honoring only the first operand: it now iterates every name like bash/zsh, printing one line per resolved name and skipping misses ([#10544](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10544)).
- Fixed hard-killed subagents vanishing from the agent registry under concurrent fan-out: `AgentLifecycleManager.release` now applies the terminal `aborted` transition before awaiting the tombstone sidecar write, closing a race where the dying session's own dispose-path unregister deleted the ref instead of leaving it as a tombstone ([#10531](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10531)).
- `omp commit` now keeps extension-provided model credentials available in its nested commit-agent session ([#10528](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10528)).
- MCP tool results now surface `structuredContent`: servers that return their payload in the structured channel while keeping `content` a terse ack (e.g. rhizome-mcp) are no longer data-less to the model ([#10522](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10522)).
- Fixed the Agent Hub roster shuffling erratically while open: rows no longer re-sort on every agent heartbeat, so the list stays stable and navigable with many active agents ([#10524](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10524)).
- Exiting Vibe mode now removes its restrictions from subsequent model turns, including restored sessions ([#10500](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10500)).
- Fixed all-sessions listing (`Tab` in session picker) and cross-project resume failing when sessions are stored under `XDG_DATA_HOME`; `listAllSessions` now scans the active `getSessionsDir()` root instead of hardcoding `~/.omp/agent/sessions`.
- Fixed the Nerd Font context icon showing a Windows logo instead of a generic window ([#10476](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10476) by [@erickmazer](https://github.com/erickmazer)).
- The debug terminal snapshot now reports Herdr (and CMUX) as the multiplexer wrapping the session, matching the TUI's pane-identity detection instead of only tmux/screen/zellij.
- Fixed vibe mode becoming un-exitable after branching a session (including via `/btw`), which previously failed with "Vibe parent session changed before mode exit could be persisted." ([#10468](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10468)).
- Fixed HTML session exports reordering interleaved assistant text, thinking, images, and tool calls in the transcript, and split matching text/tool sidebar rows with block-accurate navigation. ([#10253](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10253) by [@realcoderandom](https://github.com/realcoderandom))
- Fixed the built-in `grep` and `sed` treating a basic regular expression as an extended one: a bare `+` is now the literal and `\+` the operator, patterns like `^+` or `s/^\+/` no longer match every line, `^` anchors inside `\(…\)` and after `\|`, and a repetition operator with nothing to repeat is reported instead of silently selecting the whole file ([#10298](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10298) by [@mruangutai](https://github.com/mruangutai)).
- Fixed RPC `prompt` responses for `/skill:*` commands arriving only after the entire prompt-dispatch pipeline finished (usage preflight, compaction, provider calls): under provider stress that outlasts any client prompt timeout, so hosts reported the prompt as rejected while the turn was in fact running. The skill branch now builds the skill prompt eagerly (preserving the immediate error for an unreadable skill file) and dispatches the expensive pipeline asynchronously after answering, matching plain prompts; when the dispatch is cancelled before a turn starts (e.g. an abort overtakes usage preflight), the session now reports it through the non-invoked  completion frame instead of leaving hosts waiting for an  that never comes ([#10249](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10249) by [@cwr250](https://github.com/cwr250)).
- Fixed stale `omp-plugins.lock.json` entries loading leftover `node_modules` trees for plugins no longer declared in an existing `package.json` — the orphaned copy double-loaded its extensions. Lockfile-only plugins remain supported for manifest-less roots and symlinked packages (`omp plugin link`, marketplace runtime packages); stale entries are skipped with a warning.
